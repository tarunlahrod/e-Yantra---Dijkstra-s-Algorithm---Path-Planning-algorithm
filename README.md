# eYantra 2018
## Theme: Nutty Squirrel
<br>In our final task of e-Yantra 2018, we were asked to design a path planning algorithm (we used Dijkstra's algorithm) to complete the assigned task. We were given this map and were asked to find the shortest paths from various nodes. So the code is designed considering the map we had. Also this code has extension **ino** (as it was built on Arduino IDE).
<br>For detailed task go to **Problem Statement.pdf**.
